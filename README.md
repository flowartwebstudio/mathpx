# Mathpx

Mathpx is an experiment to help teach kids basic counting and arithmetic in the most natural way possible.  Instead of going years memorizing problems without understanding why, Mathpx is designed to make the connection between the problems written on paper to the fundamental concepts behind them.

Mathpx is an HTML5 game written with the Hoopty Javascript game framework.
